## Generate a new site

**React shop** consists of a set of npm packages.
The simplest way to get started is by using [**`react-shop-create`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shop-create) CLI utility, which sets up project automatically for you. You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files.

```bash
npx react-shop-create@latest my-website
```

When running this command you'll be asked to choose some basic application settings. After that, the CLI will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
CLI uses a Next.js [project structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure) as a basis. <br />

Run `npx npx react-shop-creat@latest --help` for more information about all available flags.

:::tip
We recommend to choose `MUI` as UI library, so that you can get started quickly with **react-shop-mui** components and features.
:::

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at https://localhost:3000/.

:::note
For certain use cases like testing on dev environment payment integration or authentication, react-shop uses `--experimental-https` flag on `dev` script, which generates a self-signed certificate.
:::

## Build

Generate an optimized version of your application for production, and preview your production site on Node.js server.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
npm run start
```
