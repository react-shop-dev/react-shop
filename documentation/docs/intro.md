# Introduction

React Shop is a set of open-source packages for building e-commerce stores, built on top of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework.

## Use cases
- Online store fronts
- DTC
- User dashboards
- Service businesses

## Overview

- **Concept**: A modular architecture promotes separation of concerns by structuring an application into independent, reusable components. One key principle is decoupling business logic from the UI, which enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability.
- **Backend agnostic**: Build your store on top of any API using Next.js features like server actions, API routes, or a [data provider](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/DataProviderList.html) with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) support.
- **Building modules**: Authentication, I18n, payments, global state managment, cart module, forms, notifications, etc. All modules are open-source, free to use for commercial purpose and available on npm.
- **UI**: Use the built-in Material UI [package](https://github.com/react-shop-dev/react-shop/tree/main/packages) or any custom design/UI framework of your choice. Supports flexible theme customization, including dark and light modes.
- **Typescript**: The data structure models follow the [Medusa.js](https://medusajs.com) commerce platform, making the Medusa admin dashboard a great choice for integration.
